<p>How can OSM be more diverse and inclusive? What can we do to improve this across all the various OSM spaces, including OSM governance? Diversity is the range of human differences, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical ability or attributes, religious or ethical values system, national origin, and political beliefs. Join us to share your lessons and ideas on how we might grow and support a Diversity and Inclusive approach in OSM.  There are Diversity and Inclusion groups across other 'open' communities. OSM has a diversity talk mailing list. This will be the place where the community can continue to connect after SOTM.</p>
<p>The goal of the session is to give space for the OSM community to talk about their needs and to plan a way forward to supporting OSM on this journey.</p>
<p>We will ask participants to co-create plans and identify how we might incorporate it into small and big activities within the global network.</p>
<p>The format will be co-created with some potential outcomes. The goal is to be a conversation with interactive, participatory methods and some small group work.</p>
