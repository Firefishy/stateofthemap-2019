<h3>Workforce Development and YouthMappers: Understanding perceptions of students in humanitarian mapping.</h3>

<p><em>Patricia Solís and Sushil Rajagopalan</em></p>
<p>The study tried to understand how and to what extent particular extracurricular (informal) activities through YouthMappers could impact workforce preparation and perceptions among students globally engaged in humanitarian mapping. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3387717#.XX_ckCgzZPY">full abstract - pdf</a></p>
<h3>“Ohsome” OpenStreetMap Data Investigation for Cities in Brazil and Germany</h3>

<p><em>Carolin Klonner, Maximilian Hartman, Lily Djam and Alexander Zipf</em></p>
<p>For an adequate use of OpenStreetMap data, its quality needs to be known beforehand. We developed a tool, which bundles different intrinsic quality-related analyses, generates visualizations, and provides CSV files of the results. It is possible to perform analyses on multiple bounding boxes for the comparison of different regions. In contrast to many other approaches, this tool does not require a local database to work on, but accesses the OpenStreetMap history data via the ohsome-API. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3387725#.XX_cdCgzZPY">full abstract - pdf</a></p>
<h3>Contextualizing OpenStreetMap in Mapping Favelas in Brazil</h3>

<p><em>Everton Bortolini and Silvana Philippi</em></p>
<p>Favelas in Brazil are spaces with unique characteristics and need to be mapped. Can OpenStreetMap be an alternative tool for this?  <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3387727#.XX_cSSgzZPY">full-abstract - pdf</a></p>
<h3>How Knowing the Purpose of Mapping Changes the Map and the Mappers Themselves</h3>

<p><em>Patricia Solís</em></p>
<p>YouthMappers engages university students in humanitarian mapping which provides a potentially valuable learning experience beyond creating the open map. It may also pique new mappers’ interest, satisfaction, and confidence in spatial technologies as well as interest in the people and places that are served by humanitarian mapping projects. This presentation shares findings of a recently published study assessing how contextual information about the purpose of the humanitarian mapping task affects mapping and mappers themselves. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3387729#.XX_cESgzZPY">full abstract - pdf</a></p>
<h3>OpenStreetMap as Space</h3>

<p><em>Dipto Sarkar and So Hoi Kay</em></p>
<p>Can OSM be used in classroom teaching as a definitive instance of a geographic space? We provide instances of how OSM as space may be of interest to researchers and for students of geography alike. Concepts of human geography manifested in OSM can be used to understand how digital geographies and offline activities are intrinsically interwoven with and influenced by each other. Thus, introduction to digital geography in classrooms can be through concepts in human geography. <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3387699#.XX_czigzZPY">full abstract - pdf</a></p>
