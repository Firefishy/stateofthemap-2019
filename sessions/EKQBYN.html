<p>Today, OpenStreetMap is heavily used at SNCF (the French Railroad Company). We have implemented our own OpenStreetMap servers with customized tiles, geocoding, reverse geocoding, uMap, OverPassApi and GraphHopper.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap rail data covers the European territory and offers a good accuracy. That is why we had the idea to rely on this great source of information for our internal needs and to go further.</p>
<p>GraphHopper is mainly used for car, pedestrian and bicycle routing. But there was a piece missing: train routing.</p>
<p>With the help of Geofabrik, the SNCF has adapted this great tool to make it work with OpenStreetMap rail data.</p>
<p>This will help us cover a vast diversity of usages such as customer information, delay calculation, distance calculation, positioning in tunnels, high accuracy positioning, map matching, and autonomous trains.</p>
<p>The project has been named OpenRailRouting and will remain open source.</p>
