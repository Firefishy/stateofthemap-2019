<p>Deep Learning approaches already proves that they can be helpful for QA or MissingMap areas.</p>
<p>RoboSat.pink as an efficient OpenSource Deep Learning toolbox dedicated to GeoSpatial Imagery, can definitely help to quickly compare two datasets, as OSM and a coverage Imagery, and do it at scale.</p>
<p>And spot where differences are significant enough, to value, that a human give them a look.</p>
<p>This talk will focus on:
- How to create an accurate trained model, for buildings and roads detection, from plain OpenData, without the needs to spend to much for hand-labeling features.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to generate predictions faster, to lower the IT hardware footprint as much as we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point here, is to allow that anyone with a recent gamer video card, already can play with this tools.</p>
<p>For information, RoboSat.pink main characteristics:
- Provides several command line tools, you can combine together to build your own workflow
- Follows geospatial standards to ease interoperability and data preparation
- OSM data loader (using PyOsmium)
- Build-in cutting edge Computer Vision model and loss implementations (and allows to replace by your owns)
- Support either RGB or multibands imagery (as multispectral)
- Allows Data Fusion
- Rich and efficient Data Augmentation abilities (using Albumentations)
- Static Web-UI tools to easily display, hilight or select results
- High performances</p>
