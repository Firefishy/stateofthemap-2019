<p>There are 250 million refugees and IDPs in informal settlements that are routinely excluded from population and settlement datasets as well as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) assessments. Here, we share results from ongoing research to map and assess SDG indicators at global informal settlements using OSM data and satellite imagery. We present a new OSM-driven schema for monitoring SDG progress that counters the exclusion of informal settlements from other assessments.</p>
