<p>It is important that the reviewer has the necessary information about the changeset and understand the diff of modifications in the OSM data.</p>
<p>For this purpose, OSMCha offers an interface similar to OpenStreetMap but with additional tools such as changeset-map to visualise the edits, information about the mapper, other information related to the changeset and OSM user history that can help the reviewer identify problematic edits on OSM. </p>
<p>During this workshop the following aspects of work with OSMCha will be highlighted:
- the basic principles of work with the interface, </p>
<ul>
<li>analysing data on the map view</li>
<li>flagging changesets as <code>bad</code> or <code>good</code> with varying levels of severity </li>
<li>
<p>getting information about changeset, data and contributor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the possibility of filtering out the data in a granular approach that helps to limit the amount of information about changes in OSM, in terms of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contributors, where you can pick up the data for a particular mapper(s) or mapping teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the date range, you can limit a number of changesets by the dates of submission to OSM and by the dates when they were reviewd in OSMCha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the reasons for suspicion, OSMCha has a range of internal functions that assign different reason for suspicion to changeset that you can use for reviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>area, where you can set up area of interest for edits inspection</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of the workshop is to engage the community to evaluate the existing data using OSMCha and improve its quality.</p>
