<p>OpenStreetMap provides a lot of valuable information about urban green spaces, but the numerous and conceptually overlapping OSM tags that describe such features lead to spatially heterogenous representations in OSM. We developed an exploratory data analysis methodology to identify locally relevant OSM tags for mapping green spaces in a specific area and compared the extracted OSM features to administrative data to evaluate the level of completeness in regard to urban green spaces.</p>
