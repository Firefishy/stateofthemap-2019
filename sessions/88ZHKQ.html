<p>JOSM is almost as old as OSM but few people really know what it takes to maintain your preferred editor.
We'll present the development model of JOSM and who's part of its active community: developers, translators, testers, plugin authors, end users, sponsors, etc.
We'll talk about the project difficulties, the major achievements made in the past years, what work is currently in progress and what will happen in the near future!</p>
