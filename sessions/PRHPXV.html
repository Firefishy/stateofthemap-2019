<h2>Mapping Advocacy: Breastfeeding Stations in the Philippines</h2>
<p><em>Jen Alconis Ayco</em>
<p>A mom mapper wants to give back to her breastfeeding support group of fellow mothers by mapping all publicly accessible breastfeeding stations in the Philippines.</p></p>
<h2>Open Data for Disaster Governance in Nepal</h2>
<p><em>Pradip Khatiwada</em>
<p>The recent proliferation of technology and open mapping brings new opportuniies to create an enabling environment where local governments and citizens work together and strive for co-created solutions to disaster problems. YI-Lab’s project on an integrated Disaster Information Management System unlocks the possibilities to use OSM datasets into disaster governance and engage local governments to contribute and strengthen on those data to enhance disaster risk reduction and preparedness.</p></p>
<h2>MapLesotho</h2>
<p><em>Tshedy Letsie</em>
<p>#MapLesotho has led to the possibility of a national spatial strategy in Lesotho, So i will do the lightning talk on how OSM data is used on Spatial Planning in Lesotho.</p></p>
<h2>State of the Map - India</h2>
<p><em>Naveen Francis </em>
<p>The talk will be about the development of mapping in India.  Current status Admin boundary mapping, Infra mapping (Road, Rail, Electricity), Protected Area Mapping and Hospital import efforts. I will also cover the efforts of creating 'Indic Language Maps' category</p></p>
<h2>OSM for Gambia(mapping the whole Gambia)</h2>
<p><em>Jariatou Jallow</em>
<p></p></p>
<h2>HOT and OSM in Tanzania, the ups and downs of crowd-sourced mapping</h2>
<p><i>Emmor Nile</i>
<p>This talk will review some of the successes and challenges of crowd-sourced mapping of OSM in rural Tanzania from 2015-2019 with Red Cross and the Tanzania Development Trust</p></p>
<h2>Community Cartographers</h2>
<p><em>Fernando Castro T</em>
<p> A short introduction to the methodology we have used at OSM Colombia to teach indigenous people and rural workers to use OSM tools to collaboratively map their communities.</p></p>
<h2>Using OpenStreetMap Building Footprints Data for Population Distribution Model: A Case Study in Cavite, Philippines</h2>
<p><em>Dinnah Feye H. Andal</em>
<p>Spatially accurate population distribution maps are essential for disaster risk assessment. Philippines has undergone rapid urbanization and population growth but existing spatial population distribution data across the country is still lacking, thus the dependence for exposure data on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is high. In this study, we explored the use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, with the census data of Cavite, Philippines in 2015 from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), in generating population distribution maps for Cavite. The results showed that OSM database can be used to produce population distribution model using GIS. However, using OSM data might have some limitations as completeness and positional accuracy of the data can vary across different study areas. Previous studies have found that the completeness of data in populated or urban areas are better compared to rural areas. The model can be best used when the quality of OSM data such as its completeness, consistency, accuracy, validity, and timeliness is high.</p></p>
<h2>Public Transport in OSM</h2>
<p><em>Porfirio Carrasco</em>
<p>In 2014 the OSM Nicaragua community started mapping Public Transport, now we are working on increasing the coverage of it mapping other cities, on this brief talk you will learn how the local
community is managing the whole project to achieve the goals and how to get easily started on Mapping the Public Transport in your city.</p></p>
<h2>Rendering order in openstreetmap-carto</h2>
<p><em>Matthijs Melissen</em>
<p>Why are tunnels under squares invisible? Why do tunnels hide buildings? Why is the Eiffel Tower invisible? Questions like these we often receive as maintainers of  openstreetmap-carto, the default
stylesheet on openstreetmap.org <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">http://openstreetmap.org</a>. Rendering order turns out to be a quite complex topic. In this short talk, I will give a brief overview of the rationale behind some of the rendering order decisions in openstreetmap-carto.</p></p>
<h2>MapATI : OpenStreetMap as a tool to help fight against the islands of urban heat</h2>
<p><em>Abdoulaye Diallo</em>
OpenStreetMap is a mapping project that aims to build a free and geographical database of the world. Following the consequences of global warming that the world is facing today through natural disasters, OSM, in addition to being a database development project, is also a tool for environmental awareness and management. By mapping urban areas (buildings, roads, points of interest) and rural or peri-urban areas where vegetation is important, this project can also be a tool to combat urban heat islands. This is done through the MapATI project, which means mapping trees or green space.</p>
