<p>I instead suggest to collect ideas with deadline 1st of September. I commit to present my ideas then and invite everyone to do so as well (on this list, the wiki, or the forum, other channels if known and openly available). This gives people not attending the conference better chances to get involved.</p>
<p>That preparation ensures that we end up with one (or more) deliverables that can be worked on. This is also the reason to prefer the BoF over a panel discussion. I am unable to organize a panel discussion in a way
such that it produces a deliverable.</p>
<p>Some keywords to foster hope that there is a way forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changeset discussions as a social feature have widespread acclaim</li>
<li>The "Any-Tag-You-Like" principle accompanies and serves OpenStreetMap since more than a decade</li>
<li>IETF's "Rough consensus" (RFC7282) has built the internet</li>
<li>many tools already facilitate to make evidence based decisions,   e.g. Taginfo in general and Taginfo's <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/highway#projects">list of tag usage</a></li>
</ul>
