<p>uMap lets you create a map with OpenStreetMap layers and embed it in your site. All within a few minutes. It is powered by open source, WTFPL-licensed software. The workshop is mainly designed for the students of the EU project. Of course everybody very welcome. No previous knowledge is expected.</p>
<p>Depending on the learning progress of the participants, we will also respond to the creation of a constantly updated map, which reads data from OverpassTurbo. Here we follow the RobJN manual "Creating an always up to date map" http://www.mappa-mercia.org/2014/09/creating-an-always-up-to-date-map.html</p>
