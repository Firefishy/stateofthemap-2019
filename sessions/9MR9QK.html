<p>SotM is about the community meeting the community. But we don't always seek out everyone we would like to talk to. So let's use this space to make sure as many members of the working groups and the board get to know each other as people and not just online text. All working group and board members are invited on the stage and can discuss anything. The public can also ask questions.</p>
