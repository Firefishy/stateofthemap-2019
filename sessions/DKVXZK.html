<p>Nomad Maps is a project carried out in partnership with the French NGO <em>CartONG</em>, created by  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alban-vivert-664331168/.">Alban Vivert</a>, a French geographer and cartographer, passionate about mapping, travel and cycling. 
Financed by a crowdfunding and a grant from the <em>Fondation de France</em>, <em>Nomad Maps across the Andes</em> had several objectives during these 5 and a half months of travel:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mapping on OpenStreetMap and Mapillary: more than 10,000 nodes mapped on OSM and more than 110,000 mapillary pictures added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet local OSM contributors: 16 contributors met and participated in the SOTM Latam 2018 in Buenos Aires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in micro collaborative mapping projects with local associations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop CartONG's Latin American partnership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a community of "NomadMappers": a community of travellers who want to make their trip useful by mapping the countries visited on OpenStreetMap.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nomad Maps documentary  deals in 28 minutes with the second goal of the project, more exactly the meeting with local OSM contributors from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>This documentary has different targets. For OSM experts, the aim is to give visibility to Latin American projects. For the non-specialists, the aim is to show the impact and relevance of OSM mapping in the humanitarian and development community in Latin America.</p>
