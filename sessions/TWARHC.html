<p>Baden-Württemberg’s Ministry of Transport aims at developing regional mobility data towards an open and interoperable framework for new mobility solutions - as part of a sustainable traffic system, realising efficiency, climate protection and living quality. On the way there, fair chances for innovation are key: Not only for better results but also for a the involvement of most different societal actors. Cross-thinking and open innovation are corner stones in such a process. </p>
<p>The keynote speech develops the need for open innovation against the background of the concept of sustainable mobility. It also gives insight into participation in innovation projects and the use of Open Street Map as a sustainable and non-discriminatory digital basis for new mobility.</p>
