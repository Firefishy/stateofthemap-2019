<p>Most of the existing attribution guidance for OSM derived works dates back to 2012 and was written before or around the change of the OSM licence to the ODbL. While there have been relevant discussions and rulings by the OSMF LWG (Licence Working Group) since then, there is no easy way to find it in one document. The LWG has undertaken to review the existing guidance and update it where necessary and is now asking for community input.</p>
